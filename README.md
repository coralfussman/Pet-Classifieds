## `Your new favorite Digital Newspaper üì∞classified sectionüóûÔ∏è`

Welcome to the Pets Classified... come indulge your imagination with the prospects of faux adoption.
All listings are pure works of fiction but may none the less bring you joy!

### IMPORTANT ** How To Start Up and Run **

to begin please clone down the repo and do:  
 `npm i`
followed by
`npm start`

**\*\***\*\*\*\***\*\*** YOU MUST ALSO START UP THE DATABASE **\*\***\*\*\*\***\*\***

To start the database (better if done in seprate terminal)

### `json-server --watch db.json --port 3004`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

Since there is no sensitive information in this repository... to avoid anyone having to create there own .env file and pass their own local host into it, I have hardcoded all fetches to localhost:3004, and have made the --watch flag command 3004. Please make sure this Port is available before running.

I have also intentionally left db.json exposed so that there wil be data available for demoing purposes, feel free to submit an entry and see it in action!

If there are any issues feel free to reach out!
`Otherwise enjoy!! `
